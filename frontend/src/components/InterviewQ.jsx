  // üåê Web Development
  { text: "Explain event delegation in JavaScript.", field: "Web Development", answer: "Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a parent element, rather than attaching separate event listeners to all its child elements. When an event is triggered on a child, it bubbles up to the parent, which handles the event based on the target element." },
  { text: "How does React's Virtual DOM work?", field: "Web Development", answer: "The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. When state changes, React updates the VDOM first. It then diffs the VDOM with the previous version and only applies the minimal necessary changes to the real DOM, optimizing performance." },
  { text: "Describe CSS Grid vs Flexbox.", field: "Web Development", answer: "Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system (row or column), best for arranging content within a single container. CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system (rows and columns), best for designing main page layouts." },
  { text: "What are JavaScript Promises?", field: "Web Development", answer: "A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected." },
  { text: "Explain async/await with an example.", field: "Web Development", answer: "Async/await is syntactic sugar built on Promises to make asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code. The 'async' keyword marks a function that returns a Promise, and 'await' pauses execution until a Promise resolves." },
  { text: "What is closure in JavaScript?", field: "Web Development", answer: "A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). It gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function, even after the outer function has finished execution." },
  { text: "Explain REST vs GraphQL.", field: "Web Development", answer: "REST relies on multiple endpoints (URLs) to access different resources, often leading to over- or under-fetching data. GraphQL uses a single endpoint and allows the client to precisely request only the data it needs, reducing payload size." },
  { text: "What is the difference between SSR and CSR?", field: "Web Development", answer: "SSR (Server-Side Rendering) renders the initial HTML on the server before sending it to the client. CSR (Client-Side Rendering) sends a minimal HTML file to the browser, which then fetches JavaScript to render content." },
  { text: "How do you optimize website performance?", field: "Web Development", answer: "Optimization techniques include: reducing HTTP requests, optimizing images, minifying CSS/JS, using browser caching, implementing lazy loading, and ensuring efficient rendering paths." },
  { text: "Explain CORS and how to handle it.", field: "Web Development", answer: "CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that restricts how a resource (like an API endpoint) on one domain can be requested by another domain. It is handled by setting the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header on the server." },
  { text: "What are WebSockets and where are they used?", field: "Web Development", answer: "WebSockets provide a persistent, two-way communication channel over a single, long-lived TCP connection.

  // üìä Data Science
  { text: "Explain the Bias-Variance trade-off.", field: "Data Science", answer: "Bias is the error from overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm (underfitting). Variance is the error from excessive complexity (overfitting). The trade-off is finding the sweet spot between these two to achieve maximum prediction accuracy." },
  { text: "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?", field: "Data Science", answer: "Supervised learning uses labeled data (input-output pairs) to train a model to predict the output. Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns and structures." },
  { text: "Describe the concept of 'p-value' and its use in testing.", field: "Data Science", answer: "The p-value is the probability of observing data as extreme as (or more extreme than) the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically < 0.05) leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis." },
  { text: "How do you handle missing data (imputation techniques)?", field: "Data Science", answer: "Methods include dropping rows/columns, filling with a constant value, filling with mean/median/mode, or using complex models (like k-Nearest Neighbors or regression) to predict the missing values." },

Recall is the ratio of true positives to all actual positives (how many relevant items are selected)." },
  { text: "Explain feature scaling and normalization.", field: "Data Science", answer: "Feature scaling transforms data to a specific range (e.g., Min-Max normalization), while standardization (Z-score normalization) transforms data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This is crucial for distance-based algorithms." },
  { text: "What are PCA and dimensionality reduction?", field: "Data Science", answer: "Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a linear technique used for this, finding directions (principal components) that maximize the variance." },

  { text: "Explain polymorphism and method overloading.", field: "Software Engineering", answer: "Polymorphism means 'many forms,' allowing an object to take on many types. Method overloading is a specific type of static polymorphism where multiple methods in the same class share the same name but have different parameters." },
  { text: "Describe the Singleton design pattern and its drawbacks.", field: "Software Engineering", answer: "The Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object. Drawbacks include making code harder to test, often hiding dependencies, and potentially violating the Single Responsibility Principle." },
  { text: "What is Big O notation and how do you analyze algorithm complexity?", field: "Software Engineering", answer: "Big O notation describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity, typically used to classify algorithms by their time or space requirement growth rate." },
  { text: "Explain the difference between threading and multi-processing.", field: "Software Engineering", answer: "Threads share the same memory space within a single process, making communication fast but prone to race conditions. Processes have separate memory spaces, making them more robust but slower for inter-process communication." },
  { text: "What is a deadlock and how can it be prevented?", field: "Software Engineering", answer: "A deadlock is a situation where two or more competing actions are waiting for the other to finish, and thus neither ever finishes. Prevention involves breaking one of the four necessary conditions: Mutual Exclusion, Hold and Wait, No Preemption, and Circular Wait." },
  { text: "Describe event bubbling and capturing.", field: "Software Engineering", answer: "When an event occurs on an element, it first travels down the DOM tree (capturing phase) to the target element, and then travels back up the DOM tree (bubbling phase) to the root. Bubbling is the default behavior." },
  { text: "Explain SOLID principles in software design.", field: "Software Engineering", answer: "SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable: Single responsibility, Open/closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, and Dependency inversion." },
  { text: "What is version control, and why is Git popular?", field: "Software Engineering", answer: "Version control systems (VCS) track and manage changes to code. Git is popular because it is a distributed VCS, meaning every developer has a full copy of the repository, enabling fast, offline work and robust branching/merging." },
  { text: "What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?", field: "Software Engineering", answer: "TDD is a software development process relying on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into specific test cases, then the code is improved to pass the new tests." },

  // üóÑÔ∏è Database Systems

It is used to quickly locate data without having to scan every row." },
  { text: "Explain database transactions with an example.", field: "Database Systems", answer: "A transaction is a single unit of work (e.g., transferring money from Account A to Account B). It typically involves multiple steps (debit A, credit B) that must either all succeed or all fail to maintain data integrity." },
  { text: "What are stored procedures and triggers?", field: "Database Systems", answer: "Stored procedures are pre-compiled SQL code saved in the database for reuse, enhancing performance and security. Triggers are special procedures automatically executed when a specific event occurs (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)." },
  { text: "Explain CAP theorem.", field: "Database Systems", answer: "The CAP theorem states that a distributed database system can only satisfy two of the following three guarantees at the same time: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. Most distributed systems prioritize Partition Tolerance." },
  { text: "What are database joins? Explain inner, outer, and cross join.", field: "Database Systems", answer: "Joins combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. Inner Join: Returns only matching rows. Outer Join (Left/Right/Full): Returns matching rows plus all rows from one or both tables, filling non-matches with NULL. Cross Join: Returns the Cartesian product of the rows." },
